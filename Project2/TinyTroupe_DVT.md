Extremely Difficult. 

First, I tried Codespace many times. after disabling my firewall, i can open the codespace on my local VS Code by 'pip install .' within the TinyTroupe directory. I also installed the package on my local machine
from 'pip install git+https://github.com/microsoft/TinyTroupe.git@main' from the microsoft github instructions.

Once that was done, the API Keys were not possible. This was a massive time suck and all together just not possible. This was NOT covered in the video. Sure, the video showed once you have the magic key, just do 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="xxxx"', but unfourtunatly nothing was covered on how to get these keys. Following the quite unclear instructions from microsoft yielded nothing but days of aggrevation and failure. No amount of chat GPT queries were of any value.

So, theoretically, this is how you would do this, but in practice, the crutial steps simply were not covered. Hopefully i won't get charged for this service by microsoft as you need an Azure account and must create resource groups to get the keys (which i did), which are VERY ambiguous in the fees. 

    2. What is Turing Test? In today's world with Large Language Models (LLMs), what is the definition of Turing Test?

If a human cannot tell if a conversation with a computer (AI, chatbot) is infact not human, the computer is said to pass the Turing Test. It's a test to see how advanced a computer is and the ability to mimic a human as to not be identified as a computer/bot/AI.


    3. Create a simulation of your own topic and show me the transcript. This implies define at least two personas of your own choice with conflict built in and observe their conversation. You can simply copy/paste the conversation in a .md file. Please comment on the transcript whether you think the Turing Test is passed.
