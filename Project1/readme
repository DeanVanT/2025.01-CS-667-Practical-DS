  1.2 details
    reliability score was using function "evaluate_reference_credibility". This just used a simple list of "trusted" domains that the input url domain was checked against a basic list:
              # Define trusted domains and their scores
        trusted_domains = {
            'edu': 0.9,    # Educational institutions
            'gov': 0.9,    # Government websites
            'org': 0.7,    # Non-profit organizations
        }
        
        # Define trusted sources
        trusted_sources = {
            'nature.com': 0.9,
            'science.org': 0.9,
            'scholar.google.com': 0.8,

  now the function was upgraded using huggingface which uses 2 new libraries: transformers and torch. as a result, i had to downgrade the numpy to 1.0 as per error message.

It actually works and kicked out a .649 score, so a little lower than i had hardcoded, so that's cool.
