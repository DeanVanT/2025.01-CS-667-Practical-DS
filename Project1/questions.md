My words:
1) simply put, an object would be synonomus with 'things' e.g, table, chair, car. to expand, you can have a function which would be a verb. I SIT (function) in a CHAIR (object).
2) this is just a way to summarize the functionality and purpose of a block of code. opposed to basic comments that are notes inline with certain lines of code
3) This is how you create new objects. by defining thier parameters, maybe height weight, size, odd or even, etc.
    done by def __init__(self):
4) This is best practices in coding. ensuring that the user can't input something that would fail and the prognram wouldn't provide an explanation (return error message) or end the program (not go into an infinite loop). Try/Catch/Except
5) i'd say make sure it's useful. aside from not returning a bad value or incompatible data type, or not returning at all and optimizing your functions to perform well, the usefullness of the return will directly impact the program. without usefull returns, the program itself will not be useful. Example would be a factorial function that implements a recursive function only to return if a value is greater than 100 when the user is looking for an exact number. kind of like our return scores. simply saying that a score 'passes' is a bit arbitrary and would be a bad return. returning all the numeric outputs with the explanations in json format would be a good return for the user.


Chat GPT outpt:

1. A class object is a blueprint for creating instances (objects) in Python. It encapsulates data and behavior related to a specific entity. Think of it as a template that defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that its instances will have. For example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Creating an instance
my_dog = Dog("Rex")
```

2. A docstring is a documentation string that describes what a function, class, or module does. It's written as the first statement in the code block and is enclosed by triple quotes. For example:

```python
def calculate_area(radius):
    """
    Calculates the area of a circle given its radius.
    
    Args:
        radius (float): The radius of the circle
        
    Returns:
        float: The area of the circle
    """
    return 3.14 * radius * radius
```

3. `__init__` is a special method (constructor) in Python classes that initializes new objects. It's called automatically when creating a new instance. For example:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """Initialize a new student with name and age."""
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

4. Functions can fail gracefully using try/except blocks to handle exceptions. Best practices include:

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
    except TypeError:
        return "Please provide numbers only"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}"
```

5. Standard practices for return statements include:
- Always return a consistent type when possible
- Return early to avoid deep nesting
- Use meaningful return values
- Handle edge cases explicitly

Example:
```python
def get_user_status(user_id):
    if not user_id:
        return None  # Early return for invalid input
    
    if user_id < 0:
        return None  # Early return for negative IDs
        
    # Main logic
    status = compute_status(user_id)
    return status  # Return the computed result
```
